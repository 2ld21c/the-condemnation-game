Imagine yourself in the far future, in a time when some of the technology of twenty-first century science fiction films is real. In particular, teleportation is real. Imagine a very simplistic version of a teleportation device consisting of two boxes, an entry box and an exit box. The boxes are in a gymnasium, placed against opposite walls with their doors facing the center of the open space between them. The operator of the device sits on a bench punching commands into a keyboard. The overhead lights grow dim and the room darkens. A hissing noise emanates from the entry box and its door opens as white steam erupts from a port on its top, rising several meters into the air. The operator looks up at you and gestures toward the box. You dutifully make your way over to it and step inside. No sooner do you turn around to face the door than it closes with a thud. Through the glass you see the operator busy again at the keyboard and the box starts to hum and vibrate. Everything outside the box starts to blur and within seconds becomes a gray fog. Then, darkness. 

The gray fog reappears and soon disappears. The gym is visible to you again. Now, however, the operator is sitting across the main floor from where he was moments ago.  Or, is he? The door opens and you step out. The operator waves you over. “How do you feel?” he asks. “Fine,” is your reply. 

“Good, good.” He taps the communication device attached to his lapel and it beeps. “The first human trial run looks like a success.” 

“Good,” comes the response from the device. “Send the subject to D4 for a physical and debriefing.”

“Very well.” Without making eye contact with you, he motions toward the nearest exit door. “You know where D4 is, don’t you?” You nod and head for the door. Twenty minutes later you’ve had your physical and an engineer and a doctor have just finished asking you a series of questions about your experience. “Do you have any questions for us?” the doctor asks you.

“Yes,” you reply. “How does it work?” The doctor looks at the engineer and nods. The engineer looks at you and begins. 

“Basically, what happens is this,...”

<br>

That night back at your apartment, you can’t fall asleep, the engineer’s words still echoing in your head. You grab some pills from the medicine cabinet, pop them into your throat, and chase them with what remains in the glass of whiskey on your nightstand. Eventually, you drift off.

You stand before the door of the entry box. It opens with a hiss and a rush of steam from its top.  You step inside and the door closes as you turn around. It latches into place and a motor spins up, the humming of it soon reaching a crescendo. A gray fog appears around the outside of the box and you realize something extremely traumatic is happening to your body and mind just before everything goes dark, both outside the box and in…
