Imagine yourself in the far future, in a time when some of the technology of twenty-first century science fiction films is real. In particular, teleportation is real. Imagine a very simplistic version of a teleportation device consisting of two boxes, an entry box and an exit box. The boxes are in a gymnasium, placed against opposite walls with their doors facing the center of the open space between them. The operator of the device sits on a bench punching commands into a keyboard. The overhead lights grow dim and the room darkens. A hissing noise emanates from the entry box and its door opens as white steam erupts from a port on its top, rising several meters into the air. The operator looks up at you and gestures toward the box. You dutifully make your way over to it and step inside. No sooner do you turn around to face the door than it closes with a thud. Through the glass you see the operator busy again at the keyboard and the box starts to hum and vibrate. Everything outside the box starts to blur and within seconds becomes a gray fog. Then, darkness. 

The gray fog reappears and soon disappears. The gym is visible to you again. Now, however, the operator is sitting across the main floor from where he was moments ago.  Or, is he? The door opens and you step out. The operator waves you over. “How do you feel?” he asks.

“Fine,” is your reply.

“Good, good.” He taps the communication device attached to his lapel and it beeps. “The first human trial run looks like a success.” 

“Excellent,” comes the response from the device. “Send the subject to D4 for a physical and debriefing.”

“Very well.” Without making eye contact with you, he motions toward the nearest exit door. “You know where D4 is, don’t you?” You nod and head for the door. Twenty minutes later you’ve had your physical and an engineer and a doctor have just finished asking you a series of questions about your experience. “Do you have any questions for us?” the doctor asks you.
“Yes,” you reply. “How does it work?” 

The doctor looks at the engineer and nods. The engineer looks at you and begins.

“Basically, what happens is this,...”

That night back at your apartment, you can’t fall asleep, the engineer’s words still echoing in your head. You grab some pills from the medicine cabinet, pop them into your throat, and chase them with what remains in the glass of whiskey on your nightstand. Eventually, you drift off.

You stand before the door of the entry box. It opens with a hiss and a rush of steam from its top.  You step inside and the door closes as you turn around. It latches into place and a motor spins up, the humming of it soon reaching a crescendo. A gray fog appears around the outside of the box and you realize something extremely traumatic is happening to your body and mind just before everything goes dark, both outside the box and in…

Now, you’re in a dark room, the engineer’s voice coming from somewhere near you, a few meters away.
“Your body was completely disintegrated,” he says. “Everything that you were was captured as information, data to be transported to another location and used to reconstruct your body, and by extension, your mind, exactly as it was prior to the disintegration process...”

Now you’re back in the box again, the inside of it lit up around you. You see the gray fog for the briefest of moments before it dissipates. The door opens and you fling yourself out, stumbling. You get your feet completely under you, run over to the operator, clutch one of his biceps and scream at him, “I remember it, God damn it! I remember!”

His eyes wide in shock, he forcefully removes your hand from his arm and backs away. “That’s just not possible,” he says, seemingly unconvinced by his own words. He taps the communication device on his lapel and his voice quavers. “I’m going to need some assistance.”

Now you’re back in D4 again with the engineer sitting across the table from you. “Do you have any questions? he asks.

“Yes,” you reply. “How does it work?”

“Basically, what happens is this. You go into the entry box and your body is disintegrated...”

“Disintegrated?”

“Yes. Your body is disintegrated, but not before an entire virtual replica of you is constructed out of data, data representing your exact physical constitution. Your memories up to that point and everything else you would call your mind has been preserved as information. That information is then transported to the exit box where your body as well as your mental states are reconstructed exactly as they were just before disintegration.”

“Are you saying that I’m an exact replica of someone who was destroyed?”

“Destroyed? Come on, now… aren’t you you? The same person who went into the box? Certainly, you don’t feel like someone else? Do you?

“No, but, technically speaking,...”

“So now you’re going to explain things technically to me? I helped design the device.”

“So, what happened to the, uh,... disintegrated me?”

“It’s best that we don’t talk about that right now; you’ve had a long day, and this must be a lot to absorb,...”

You wake up in your bed drenched in sweat, the empty whiskey glass on the nightstand inches from your face.  It seems you’d forgotten to turn off the lamp before nodding off. You turn it off now, get out of bed, and go to the window. The moon casts an eerie glow upon the world. You’re quite sleepy and would like to go back to bed, but you’re haunted by the notion that a different person may wake up in your bed in the morning.

Of course, this was just a little use of the imagination, and such technology remains in the realm of science fiction, but the notion that transportation by such a device presents a situation where one person steps into the entry box and possibly a completely different one steps out, gives us a chance to think of something we all take for granted, personal identity. In fact, the teleportation example used as a vehicle to talk about personal identity was used by philosopher Derek Parfit in his famous book “Reasons and Persons.” He extends the example to have the reader consider an improvement upon the original technology where the person in the entry box is not destroyed before an exact replica is produced in another location (on Mars in his example). However, the process of scanning the original person causes a terminal heart condition leaving that person with only days to live. In those remaining days the original and the duplicate are allowed to communicate with each other, the dying one left with a chance to try and find some kind of peace in knowing that someone with their identity will carry on in space and time.

To take it a little farther, imagine stepping into the box, remaining conscious throughout the process, and stepping back out of the entry box to find the operator standing there waiting for you.

“What now?” you ask.

“Your duplicate has been created at the other end and is now undergoing an examination. It should only take about ten minutes.”

“A physical examination? Checking for defects?”

“Yes. And also they’ll have to answer a specific set of questions about you?”

“Me?”

“You. Them. There shouldn’t be any differences.”

“What if there are differences?”

The communication device on his lapel beeps and a voice comes through a second later, “Physical examination complete. Cognitive check underway.”

The operator presses the device and speaks, “Understood. Standing by.”

“Wait,” you say, “what if there are differences? What if they fail the cognitive check?”

“It’s best you don’t concern yourself with that.”

“Suppose the cognitive check is alright. What then?”

Somehow it had escaped your attention before, but now you notice a pistol in a holster on the operator’s hip. You turn to flee, but somehow two armed guards managed to come up behind you while you were in dialog with the operator…

<br>

Who are you? That is to say, what makes you you? You may feel a sense of ownership of your identity, as you define it, by your given name, family history, nationality, physical appearance, and possibly religious and political affiliations. But, without making reference to any of these, how would you define yourself? By your experiences, including that which has happened to you and that which has been done by you? Or, just by your deeds alone, say, for example, how frequently you’ve been able to act in line with the rules of society or some personal moral code you’ve written for yourself? Are you the same person you were five years ago? Will you be the same person five years from now?

Look inward. What do you see there? Are there memories popping into your head now? Many recent, many not so? Maybe you're seeing your face in a childhood photograph, or your reflection in the mirror this morning, maybe you're recalling an argument with a loved one, or an enjoyable social event... Is that you there? Are you flitting from one moment in the past to another? That kid holding a fish just caught becomes the kid with unusually long hair playing a guitar. Now he's got his arm around the shoulders of a girl around his age, both teenagers. Is that you? The girl too afraid to join her friends in the lake on a sultry summer evening, now feeling ecstatic upon learning that she's been accepted to a top-tier university. Is that you?

Who are you? Keep looking inward. Are you there? Is there some center, someone at the controls, directing the flow of memories, trying to form some image of the self in order to answer the question? 
The question which, by the way, you still haven't answered. 

"Who are you?"

"I’m the one looking inward and asking the question, Who am I?"

"And, if I may persist, who is *that*?"

Are you sure you know who you are? Surely, your own thoughts about yourself will be different than the ones your friends and loved ones have about you, and will be even more different still than the ones those who are not so close to you will have. But, for this exercise, as much as possible, you shouldn’t be using what you’ve heard about yourself from others to guide your thoughts. This is completely about who you think you are. Retreat into your mind and take a kind of self-inventory. Take as much time as you need…

Maybe it’ll take some time for you to come up with a response to this question, or maybe you have a clear idea in your mind and can quickly and confidently answer it. Either way, let’s imagine someone who can do the latter. Imagine you’re at a party, a cocktail party, attended by mostly well-educated, successful professionals, and you meet someone. You introduce yourself, and she does the same. She says, “I’m Jane Jones. I’m the chief of neurosurgery at St. Christopher’s Hospital.”And, with that little bit of information, you feel you know something meaningful about this person; how hard she must have worked up to this point in her life, and how capable of facing and overcoming difficult problems she must be, for example. But, do we know anywhere near enough to answer the question, Who is Jane Jones? We could ask her what her hobbies are. We could be rude and pry into her life by asking questions about her childhood… What was your best childhood memory? Your most traumatic experience growing up? What single event in your life had the biggest effect in defining who you are? Of course, we wouldn’t ask such personal questions of someone we’ve just met at a party; however, if we were to ask them, they would give us a chance to develop a better idea of the nature of Jane Jones, or, as they say, what makes her tick.

Let’s say we do ask about her hobbies, and we find out that she’s an avid trekker, and when she gets some vacation time, she likes to go trekking through jungles, and that actually she’s got a trip planned for next week to go to South America and do just that. Now, fast forward a week and a half, and imagine she’s in the middle of her jungle excursion, and her travel partner gets injured. With her friend unable to move, Jane decides to go and get help. She hikes for a few hours until she comes to a village. There, she uses a Spanish phrase from her guidebook to ask the first person she comes across if there’s anyone around who speaks English. A few minutes later, a young woman comes up to Jane and greets her in English and Jane greets her back warmly before explaining her situation. The woman tells Jane to wait and rushes off to a nearby house. Another few minutes pass before she returns with a man and another woman, who quickly seize Jane and drag her away to a tool shed. They lock her in, and this begins a year-long ordeal for Jane which has her held captive by a rebel faction living deep in the jungle, unable to escape, underfed, and constantly threatened with death for being uncooperative.

It’s likely that for years, until the time of her abduction, Jane Jones’s personal narrative was anchored to her career as a neurosurgeon. This is easy enough to accept given that she would have had no other single focus in her life to which she would have dedicated as much time as she had to her work. But, after a year in captivity enduring what would seem unendurable to most people with backgrounds similar to Jane’s, would her medical career still be the anchor of her personal narrative? It wouldn’t be hard to imagine Jane going home upon being freed, not returning to work as a surgeon, and choosing to write a book about her harrowing experience. Maybe the book becomes a best-seller and leaves her financially able to not have to return to a full-time working life. Maybe from there, she continues writing, goes on book promotion tours, and does the occasional radio/podcast, TV, or magazine interview. Maybe she becomes a leader of support groups for victims traumatized by violent behavior. It would seem the focus of her personal narrative has changed. Maybe her outlook on the world has changed so dramatically that she has a difficult time remembering the feeling of career satisfaction she had before as a surgeon. She would likely claim to be a different person than the one she was prior to her abduction, and it would be pretty easy for most people to understand why. 

“Who is Jane Jones?” 

“She’s the person who was a neurosurgeon for a while, and then became a well-known author of books about surviving trauma.”

“It sounds like we’re literally talking about two different people here.”
	
Now, you might say that it’s intellectually dishonest here to ignore the fact that there seems to be a way in which we can infer the existence of some specific characteristics in Jane which are manifested in her behavior, ones which informed not only the ways in which she handled becoming and being a neurosurgeon, but also in the ways that she dealt with her experience as a captive and, subsequently, a trauma survivor. Maybe it would be better to use these inferred characteristics to determine Jane’s identity. But, even if we do so, we’re talking about an identity determined from our ideas about Jane, not hers. 

Personal identity has been a topic of philosophy for as long as philosophy has been around. One of the oldest examples in western philosophy concerning identity over time is the one of the Ship of Theseus, Theseus being one of the major heroic figures of Greek mythology. The paradox of the Ship of Theseus raises the question of whether or not an object that’s had all of its constituent parts replaced, piece by piece over an extended period of time, is still, essentially the same object. Imagine you’re an artist who produces extremely realistic paintings, and you’re transported back to the time of Theseus. Theseus one day asks you to paint his ship. You do, and afterward, Theseus thanks you, takes his painting, and sets out to sea.

Five years later, he returns from his journey and asks you to paint his ship again. And again, you do. Theseus, later that day, brings out the painting you did five years before and sets it next to the one you’ve just finished. He looks long at one, and then the other, and says, “This ship and I have been through some legendary times together.”

You also carefully look at both paintings and you see two decidedly different images. You then say, “But, Theseus, these are two different ships! What happened to the one I painted 5 years ago?” He explains that on several occasions over the last five years, damaged and worn parts were replaced, and in fact, the final original plank was replaced last week. Theseus then squints his eyes at you and says, “I hope you’re not implying that this ship you see here before you is not the Ship of Theseus, because… I might have to smite you.”

Not one to be intimidated easily, you say, “Well, if all of the wooden parts of the ship I painted five years ago have been replaced, meaning none of that which makes up this ship here before us now was part of the ship you sailed in on five years before, aren’t we talking about two different ships?”

He says, “This ship is the Ship of Theseus, and so was the one you painted five years ago. Not once in five years did Theseus wander far from his ship, even during times of battle. The Ship of Theseus was always with Theseus and Theseus was always with his ship. Are you saying that someone replaced Theseus’s ship while he was sleeping or put under some kind of spell?”

“No,” you say, “I’m only saying that looking at these two different paintings, I see two different ships.”
He folds his arms, “So, at some point, due to the original parts of Theseus’s ship having been replaced, Theseus came to have a new ship, is that it? If so, then during which part replacement *did* Theseus come to have a new ship?”

You see how it goes, right?

A modern version of such a paradox centers around the idea of replacing neurons in the brain incrementally over time with electronic counterparts, a process done carefully to keep from interrupting consciousness. And all done in order to move one’s mind from an organic device, meaning the brain, to an inorganic one. The question is, as you’ve likely guessed, would the mind be the same even though we end up with two physically different objects? 
Concerning the notion of the self, 18th-century philosopher David Hume wrote: 

“There are some philosophers who imagine we are every moment intimately conscious of what we call ourself; that we feel its existence and its continuance in existence; and are certain, beyond the evidence of a demonstration, both of its perfect identity and simplicity.”

Hume thought that though we have a sense of self, a self which seems to us to be an entity with a continuous existence, he thought that this was just an illusion. He thought that some inner working of the mind makes it seem as if all of our experiences are strung together in a meaningful way that gives rise to a sense of personal identity. Borrowing from John Locke before him, Hume says that the content of your mind is divided up into perceptions. And, for him, there are two types of perceptions, impressions and ideas. Impressions include sensations, what we get from our five senses, as well as pleasure and pain. Emotions, desires and passions are impressions as well.

Ideas, Hume says, are, “the faint images of these in thinking and reasoning.” ‘These,’ being impressions. In other words, ideas are copies of impressions. He put forth the following proposition: “All our simple ideas in their first appearance are derived from simple impressions, which are correspondent to them, and which they exactly represent.” 

Note here, that he’s only talking about simple impressions and simple ideas, even though impressions and ideas can be complex as well. Ideas come from impressions, and impressions are made in experience. You see a red rose held up against the backdrop of a bright blue sky. You smell it, feel the texture of its petals… All of this makes an impression in your mind. And later, when you recall this experience, all of this remains, but presents itself in your mind with less intensity, or as Hume put it, with less “force and vivacity.” This memory of the experience is the idea derived from the original impression.

Imagine a child who has never tasted chocolate before, but has had sweet things, like a perfectly ripened peach or tapioca pudding. If you were to describe the taste and texture of chocolate to them, would they be able to piece together the experiences of eating a peach and eating tapioca pudding in such a way that they would gain a fairly good idea of the taste of chocolate? Of course, not. You could tell them that chocolate is sweet and creamy, and even though a perfectly ripened peach is sweet and tapioca creamy, experiences with those two foods are not enough; if you were to give that kid a piece of chocolate after describing the taste, you wouldn’t expect them to go, “Oh, OK, I thought that’s how it would taste.” 

You could take all of the words that have ever been used to describe the taste of chocolate, and even if you have impressions of the tastes belonging to those words individually, you can’t combine them in any way to give yourself an idea of the taste of chocolate that would even come close to the idea as you would have it after actually trying it.

A person trying chocolate for the first time develops a concrete idea from the impression gotten from the experience. A day or two later, that person will still be able to recall the taste of that first piece of chocolate to some degree, the recollection being Hume’s idea of a faded copy of the original impression. From that point on, though that person will have several different experiences of tasting different kinds of chocolate, whatever idea they develop about the general taste of chocolate will just be an abstract amalgamation made of up of several concrete experiences, no matter how convinced they are that they have a real, concrete notion of some general ‘taste of chocolate’.

To sum it up, individual experiences in tasting chocolate provide us with distinct impressions which give rise to distinct ideas. All those impressions and ideas, what Hume called perceptions, get bundled together somehow and we’re left with a sense of some intangible thing that we would call, ‘the taste of chocolate.’And, this bundle of perceptions is not something that we can have a simple idea of, as a distinct whole, or self-contained unit, because we can have no simple impression of it (Recall that simple ideas come from simple impressions, according to Hume). You have no simple, invariant impression of the general taste of chocolate, which you can easily understand, because every time you taste a new kind of chocolate, your bundle of perceptions (in this case what we’re calling ‘the general taste of chocolate’) grows. 
In *A Treatise of Human Nature*, Hume says:

“We have a distinct idea of an object, that remains invariable and uninterrupted through a supposed variation of time; and this idea we call identity or sameness.”

Think of your distinct idea of the taste of an individual piece of chocolate, an idea based on an impression from a single experience with a single object, say a piece of milk chocolate that gave you your first experience in the world of chocolate. That distinct idea came from a concrete experience.
Hume also says:

“We have also a distinct idea of several different objects existing in succession, and connected by a close relation;”

These different objects existing in succession are the different chocolate-tasting experiences, and the distinct ideas of the individual objects (in this case ideas arising from impressions gotten during tasting experiences) get bundled together, or as Hume put it just now, get “connected by a close relation,” and that gives rise to a sense (a distinct idea as Hume would say) of the general taste of chocolate. The key here being that the distinct idea you have of the general taste of chocolate is an abstract idea, and the distinct ideas you have of the individual chocolate tastes are concrete ones. 

Simply put, your mind allows you to have distinct concrete ideas and distinct abstract ideas. This is crucial to understanding Hume’s argument. Let’s let him put it all together for you now, repeating the beginning of the crucial passage from *the Treatise*, and continuing…

“We have a distinct idea of an object, that remains invariable and uninterrupted through a supposed variation of time; and this idea we call that of identity, or sameness. We have also a distinct idea of several different objects existing in succession, and connected together by a close relation; and this to an accurate view affords as perfect a notion of diversity, as if there was no manner of relation among the objects. But though these two ideas of identity, and a succession of related objects be in themselves perfectly distinct, and even contrary, yet it is certain, that in our common way of thinking they are generally confounded with each other. That action of the imagination, by which we consider the uninterrupted and invariable object, and that by which we reflect on the succession of related objects, are almost the same to the feeling, nor is there much more effort of thought required in the latter case than in the former. The relation facilitates the transition of the mind from one object to another, and renders its passage as smooth as if it contemplated one continued object. This resemblance is the cause of the confusion and mistake, and makes us substitute the notion of identity, instead of that of related objects.”

In short we have a notion of identity for individual objects that remain seemingly unchanged over time, and we have an accurate notion of diversity of similar but different objects when we focus on the differences. But somehow, depending on the perceived strength of the relation between different objects, when we consider them as a group, and not focus on the differences, our minds allow us to perceive the group of objects as a distinct whole, and therefore give us a sense that that this distinct abstract whole has an identity. This is something the mind does below the level of awareness, of course, and is what leads to what we know of today as cognitive biases.

The notion that the sense of Self we all have is real, yet the Self as a singular, invariant entity isn’t, should be somewhat easier to understand by now, even if you don’t buy into it. To solidify things before moving on, let’s look at one more example of similar objects being brought under one category and having that category conflated with the individual objects. 

Many people buy cars and keep them in their garages. Is this what you do? Every morning when you go to work, do you go into the garage, see the car, get in and drive away? Do you open the main garage door before you attempt to leave… 
Either way, imagine, instead of buying a single car, you subscribe to a service in which, for a monthly fee, a new car is delivered to your garage every night and each morning you enter the garage and are greeted by the sight of a car different than the one you drove the day before. In fact, it takes months before you end up with the same model again. When you see the car, get in it, and drive it, you notice the differences, but when you’re in your house and you think about what’s in the garage, you think of it in general as a car, without focusing on the variations of car you’ve experienced. Over time, you come to think of whatever is parked in the garage as THE CAR, even though when you go and actually look in the garage, you see a different object than the one that was there the day before. When you’re not focused on the differences between related objects (the cars in this example), your mind allows those related objects in the group to seem to bleed into each other and be perceived as an individual extended unit and gives you a sense of the group of related objects having a distinct identity in the same way it would give you a sense of identity for an individual object. Our minds, before we’re aware of it, can substitute the notion of identity for the notion of related objects. Prejudices you have based on appearances of, say, people result from this inescapable working of the mind, meaning that if you’ve consciously thought that it’s desirable to not have these prejudices, you have to consciously fight against the natural workings of your mind. As stated already, we know this problem as one of cognitive bias. It makes sense to think we have similar prejudices regarding ourselves.

Think of all of your perceptions. What do they have in common? Think of someone who last week slipped on some ice on the ground and broke her arm, and is now eating chocolate. The act of slipping and breaking an arm and the act of eating chocolate have very little in common. But, for the person having both of those experiences, and therefore the impressions and ideas connected to them individually, the relationship is that both of those experiences happened to her. She’s the connection, the relation. And if she runs through various perceptions based on experiences in her mind, her mind will come to render the passage from one perception to the next as smooth as if it were contemplating one continuous object, and therefore substitute the notion of personal identity for the notion of related experiences, experiences which are, by and large, related only in the sense that they belong to one experiencer.

Considering what we’ve looked at so far, what you are at any moment is a snapshot, a fleeting articulation of an ever-changing whole with no obvious anchor point. Being an entity with an ongoing inner subjective experience, you are constantly being bombarded by new experiences which challenge beliefs and give rise to different views about the world, shaping ways of thinking about it and guiding your interactions with it. If you can at all remember what it was like to be an eight-year-old, how much of what you experience these days gives you the sense of what it was like to hold the attitudes, beliefs, and desires which that eight-year-old child held? Some of those attitudes, beliefs and desires must have persisted, but how much of your inner subjective experience these days is like the inner subjective experience of that eight-year-old? Certainly, no rational adult would claim that what it's like to be her now is exactly, or even similar to, what it was like to be her at the age of eight.

One’s inner subjective experience now is not the same as it was then. And, if you accept that, then this would logically hold true for an individual over any time span, which we could make as arbitrarily small as we like. Of course, the smaller we make the time span, the more we see a convergence of the two inner subjective experiences.

Thinking of every moment in one one's life as a snapshot, which captures all of one's mental states (feelings, awareness of past experiences, beliefs, ideas, etc...) and comparing one momentary snapshot to the one immediately following it, we're not likely to see any tangible change. It's like a copy of the mind has been made and sent one moment into the future. Over time, examining the snapshots, we would see that the individual memories would persist (though possibly degraded or passively altered in some way), but the momentary configurations of the mental states would be changed (some beliefs no longer held, for example), and we would see what appeared to be two different individuals, yet the person in question will hold onto the sense of having a continuing personal identity while being inclined to say things like, *That was then and this is now; I'm not the person I used to be*.

The way experiences with the world create enduring impressions in one's mind leads to a propensity for creating a narrative, a fiction of the mind that allows one to believe that all those experiences are connected in some meaningful way that defines the experiencer. Yet, we know that new experiences change ways of thinking that were brought about by previous experiences. Sometimes we undergo such profound changes in thinking that we end up holding negative attitudes toward those past experiences which led to beliefs and patterns of thought we now eschew.

Are we to think of those past experiences as bad? Are we to think we were mistaken to have let them inform our thinking in the ways that they did? Or, should we believe that all experiences are meaningful in that they help us learn and grow? Does undergoing change by having new experiences necessarily foster growth? Unless you’re perfect in your self-deception, it’s likely you’re aware of periods of psychological regression in your past, and are aware of such periods in the lives of others you have a relatively close connection to.

Maybe Uncle Joe, who until two years ago was thought of as a kind and considerate man by most of his family and friends, lost not only his well-paying job at the automobile manufacturing plant, but also his marriage soon afterward. Maybe he then became bitter and hateful, alienating his grown children and close friends. Maybe last month he committed suicide, ending his life on what anyone would think of as a tragic note. Who would look at the entirety of his time on earth and say it was all very meaningful? Indeed, it’s likely Uncle Joe in his last days would have ruminated on what he took to be the meaninglessness of it all. Someone who knew Uncle Joe only in the days before he lost his job would likely identify him as a kind and considerate person, while someone who only knew him in the last few months of his life could easily identify him as a bitter and hateful one. How would someone who knew him all along identify him? 

“Who was Joe?” 

“He was a kind and considerate person who became a bitter and hateful one after losing his job and his marriage.”

“So, he was one person for most of his life, and a different one in the last part of it?”

“Well, yes.” 

Does this conversation make any sense? It might, given the way that most of us look at the world, but maybe the way that most of us look at the world doesn’t make any logical sense. Whether the succession of experiences each of us undergoes in life has a fundamental cause or is pure randomness, we can’t know, yet it’s in our nature to think that all of an individual’s experiences are strung together in some essential way that gives rise to an identity.

All of your experiences change your beliefs and attitudes toward different people, places, things and ideas. New experiences are happening right now to you, an entity which holds many beliefs and attitudes toward different people, places, things and ideas that it didn't hold years before. This entity we call 'the Self', what is it? Philosopher David Hume says that you are a ‘bundle of perceptions.’ Right now, you are a momentary expression of an ever-changing unity of mental states, such as beliefs, thoughts, desires, perceptions, and imaginings. Right now, you are the one who knows what it's like to be you at this moment. And what it's like to be you now is certainly not what it was like to be you when you were eight years old. What it's like to be you now is not what it was like to be you before. The same is true for all of us. Yet, we hold on to the past and remain fascinated by our own personal stories.

What vain creatures we are. 

It’s instructive to look at the language we use when we want to communicate information about ourselves to others. One could say, for example, I am kind. Now, if you were interviewing someone and asked him to tell you a little about himself, and this was his response, you’d justifiably feel a bit uncomfortable; it’s a fairly childish way of describing a single aspect of one’s personality. We could assume that what is meant here is that he believes he tends to behave kindly toward others, or we could assume that he believes he always treats others in a kind manner. Either way, if we take him at his word, then we believe something about his behavioral tendencies, not some internal property of an enduring soul. If we ask another, one who knows our subject, to tell us something about him, and the response is, He is kind, we don’t feel so uncomfortable with the statement because we know that the person making it is using only their experience with the subject to make such a judgment, which necessarily means it is a comment about his general behavioral tendencies. Someone who knows the subject very well may say something like, He is a kind soul, and we wouldn’t change our assumption that it is only a judgment based on the reporter’s experience with the subject. And since knowledge is limited by experience, we can’t assume the reporter has anything like complete knowledge of the subject.

But, what about the subject himself? His experience with himself is continuous and ongoing. Does this mean he has complete knowledge of himself? Wouldn’t the answer to that question depend on what we consider the self to be? Consider the case of one who, for a period of a few years, behaved in an abusive way toward her elderly mother while taking care of her. Imagine that during her mother’s final few months of life, the daughter came to regret how she had treated her, and for that final period was a loving and patient caregiver. It’s likely that that sense of regret would carry on long after her mother’s passing, and if someone, one who only observed that mother/daughter relationship in the final few months, were to say to her, You are kind. You are caring. You are a good person, we can imagine she would recall how badly she had treated her mother and would think, No, I’m not a good person. This other, who had only observed our subject’s treatment of her mother during the final months makes a judgment based on a very limited range of experiences while the subject herself bases her judgment on a much wider range of experiences. In both cases, however, judgments about behavior are being used to define an individual, not some kind of knowledge of internal characteristics. Of course, the observer wouldn’t have any direct knowledge of such innate traits, but would the subject have any such knowledge herself? 

Do these essential characteristics exist at all? When you took your self-inventory, did you come across any of these traits? 

Consider some behavior you believe to be morally reprehensible. You might say to yourself with confidence, I would never do such a thing, and you might conclude that your sense of confidence about it is proof enough that some internal goodness exists within you, but can you be sure it really exists? Is there anything you’ve ever done which you had previously thought to be immoral? And if you thought such a behavior to be immoral, do you know why you thought it to be so? 
When you took your self-inventory you came across memories of past behavior, thoughts and feelings. You also came across current thoughts and feelings. But, did you come across a perception of yourself as a whole? You may have felt a strong sense of self, but did you perceive anything concretely in the same way you perceived past and present thoughts and feelings or certain memories? Again, who are you?

Each of us has a sense of self, and as a result, a sense of personal identity. But, what is that in concrete terms? It’s easy to imagine some enduring central figure, a soul if you will, in each of us, but this is just an imagining. A sense of personal identity is a product of an ongoing inner subjective experience. What it’s like to be you from one moment to the next changes over time, but the memories endure, each one imprinted with something that identifies it as having been created through your unique perspective, something that signifies that it belongs to you. This identifier that appears in all of your experiences is a part of something which brings all of them under a concept you call ‘my self.’

Rather than the question, Who are you? Consider the question What are you? The question Who are you? is meant to provoke an answer about your place in the world of other people; the question What are you? is meant to provoke an answer about your place in the universe. It should be obvious which one has a deeper philosophical context.

Consider a couple, Robert and Jane, who have just learned that the baby Jane will give birth to several months hence has been determined to be a boy. “Mike will be his name then,” Jane exclaims gleefully and Robert, wiping a tear from his cheek, says, “Yes, yes,” recalling their discussion of potential names a few months earlier. They’ve talked extensively about the best ways to bring up a child. They’ve talked about the values they wish to instill in their offspring and have discussed in detail how they plan to work together to care for their newborn in the first months of life outside the womb. 
By now, in their minds, Mike has an identity. They can see, each in their own way, how they will project themselves into the little boy. When Jane sees little Mike wrapped up in a blanket sleeping, she will think of him in terms of what he is to become, and she will feel a most-special kind of attachment to him, which comes not only from the biological connection, but also from the months she has spent building up Mike’s identity in her mind. When Robert comes into the room and sees his infant son lying on his back on the bed next to his mother, his eyes wide open gazing at the ceiling, mouth twitching while his arms and legs move about wildly, he may see in the boy a mixed sense of wonder and confusion about the world around him.

When you, Robert’s friend from work, wander into the room a moment later and meet little Mike for the first time, and see the boy stop moving his arms and legs while still staring upward, maybe you think, Uh, looks like the little guy just realized a poo is coming. Well, he probably isn’t even aware of what it is that’s coming… doesn’t look aware of much at all. “Lovely little boy you’ve got there, guys,” you say as Mike suddenly scrunches his eyes shut and begins to cry. “Uh-oh,” you say, take a sip from your beer, and casually stride out of the room.<br>
For parents of a newborn, it’s perfectly natural for them to say things like, “Mike must be hungry,” or “Susie’s all worn out; it’s been a long day.” Looking at the life of a newborn baby objectively, however, one might feel a bit strange referring to it by its name given the fact that it doesn’t have the slightest idea of where it’s at or what’s going on around it, let alone its own name or what it even means to have a name. In the minds of the parents, the baby has an identity, and therefore a need for a name, but in the mind of the child, there isn’t anything like a sense of personal identity yet.

Let’s return to your self-inventory. What conclusions did you come to about yourself? What do you believe about yourself? For example, do you believe you’re a good person? If so, what are your standards for evaluation? What makes a person good or not? How often do you find yourself acting out of line with your moral code while still feeling that because your intentions are good, you are generally a good person? How many times will you have to fail to act in a morally correct way, as prescribed by you, before you start to think that good intentions aren’t enough, and that maybe, you aren’t really a good person? 

Or, maybe, you almost never act out of line with your moral code, but you often think what you consider to be immoral thoughts; do you believe yourself to be a good person because you regulate your behavior well and don’t act according to your immoral thoughts/impulses, or do you feel you’re really a bad person just playing at being a good one? 

Of course, these questions aren’t designed to make you feel good or bad about yourself; they’re meant to get you thinking about your sense of personal identity. There’s no doubt that you, an individual with an ongoing inner subjective experience, have a sense of being a unique person with a unique identity. What makes you so unique, though? Surely, the fact that you are biologically unique must mean that there are physical factors which determined your brain’s development, which in turn determined to a certain degree your mind’s development in a unique way.

So, to make the question a little more meaningful, when considering your own sense of personal identity, what gives you the feeling that you are unique, that you are different enough from others to, say, be desired as a friend or lover? You could put the question to some random passerby on the street…

“I’m just an ordinary, average guy; I put on my pants one leg at a time, the same as everyone else.”

“Are you in a relationship currently?”

“Yeah, married for seven years.”

“What is it about you that makes your, um…”

“My wife?”

“Yes. What is it about you that makes your wife feel you are the best life partner for her?”

“Haha, I dunno. I ask myself that often enough. Maybe you should ask her.”

“So, it seems reasonable to you that there’s a chance your wife will meet someone she finds more worthy of her time, and therefore her hand in marriage?”

“I don’t really appreciate this line of questioning.”

“That’s understandable, but it’s not meant to be insulting to you in any way; it’s just to determine your uniqueness. So, to continue, what do you think it is about you that makes your wife want to stay with you?”

“Well, I am a pretty funny guy...”

“So, your wife made finding a guy with an exceptionally good sense of humor her main priority in deciding on who to marry?”

“Hey, look, I don’t know…”

“Was it your job?”

“What? No. She makes more money than I do.”

“So, what do you think it is about you that keeps her from finding another partner?”

“Look, I don’t really like where this is going?”

“Alright, the question is withdrawn. Thank you for your time…”

“OK, fine. We have history, my wife and I. Shared experience, you know? Ups, downs, good times, bad times. There’s a special bond between us.”

“But, why did she let a history with you develop at all?”

“Oh, Jesus! I don’t know, OK?!”

“Are you saying you somehow lucked into a relationship with her and now you’re just trying to hold on to what luck brought you?”

“OK, now you can fuck off.”

You may have done things in your life that most people in your society would call impressive. You might be a self-made millionaire, or you might be a war veteran with numerous awards for valor. Maybe you’re the chief of neurosurgery at the city’s top hospital. Few would have trouble understanding why having accomplished such things would bring about a strong sense of pride within an individual, but what happens when the feelings of pride become dulled over time. Looking at the dossier of a highly decorated war veteran who ended up going to medical school, becoming a successful surgeon, and then becoming the chief of neurosurgery at the city’s most prestigious hospital would be enough for most people to conclude that this person must have a strong sense of self-worth. However, information not contained in the document could be enough to make that not the case. We can imagine such an individual driving home one particularly snowy night with her daughter after picking her up from a piano lesson, hitting an icy patch on the road, sliding into oncoming traffic and colliding with another vehicle, leaving her injured and her daughter dead.
It’s not uncommon for those who’ve gone through such experiences to feel extraordinary guilt and feelings of self-loathing. In the course of one night, she may have gone from having a strong sense of purpose in life, and therefore a strong sense of personal identity, to being someone constantly longing to numb herself with alcohol in order to dull the pain of self-awareness, not wanting to be seen and recognized, wanting to slip anonymously into the abyss. Of course, this isn’t standard, and most people continue to want to represent themselves positively in the world throughout their lives. 
For those who aren’t blessed with all the things that give one mass appeal, constructing the closest approximation to the ideal identity may become a major focus in their lives. At this point, we should consider an essential truth of human nature, a maxim: 

*Before you can represent yourself in the world, the world must have represented a part of itself in you.* 

Consider the following from Immanuel Kant’s *Critique of Pure Reason*:

“That all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt. For how should the faculty of knowledge be called into activity, if not by objects which affect our senses and which, on the one hand, produce representations by themselves or on the other, rouse the activity of our understanding to compare, connect, or separate them and thus to convert the raw material of our sensible impressions into knowledge of objects, which we call experience? With respect to time, therefore, no knowledge within us is antecedent to experience, but all knowledge begins with it.”

You were born out of the world and not into it. Though your DNA plays a major part in determining how your mind will develop, without experience of the world outside your skull, you wouldn’t have anything like the sense of identity you have now. Interaction with the outer world shapes one’s inner world and serves to construct one’s sense of personal identity, and at the same time also serves to construct a sense of the individual’s identity in the minds of those around him. And of course, among those people around him, the identity they ascribe to him will be different from one person to the next, a difference influenced largely by how each of those minds was shaped by its own individual experience.  
Needless to say, much of who/what you perceive yourself to be comes from where you’ve been, what you’ve seen, what you’ve touched and tasted, and what you’ve learned. We tend to think of the mind as the essence of an individual. Without a mind, you don’t have a person. A brilliant mind is seen as a gift, and a deranged one is seen as a curse.

When two people create a new individual, and therefore a new mind in the world, they know that it is partly a product of their combined genetic contributions and partly a product of its interactions with the world, which in the early years will be largely guided by them, if they are present. They intend to send a part of themselves into the future while hoping that their offspring will become unique individuals in their own right and carve out a new worldview from the myriad of experiences they undergo. What nature ‘intends’ to do with these newly created minds, however, has less to do with their needs individually and more to do with the propagation of the species. To speak of nature’s intentions, though, is a human thing to do; using anthropomorphism to coin terms like ‘Mother Nature’ is problematic, of course, because it imbues our minds with a misguided sense of a benevolent benefactor who is concerned with our well-being and is constantly seeking to nurture us despite the fact that our senses tell us that natural processes can be just as ‘cruel’ to living things as they are ‘kind.’

Who are you?

We’ll finish this chapter with the following passage on personal identity from Hume’s *A Treatise of Human Nature*,

“But, farther, what must become of all our particular perceptions upon this hypothesis? All these are different, and distinguishable, and separable from each other, and may be separately considered, and may exist separately, and have no Deed of tiny thing to support their existence. After what manner, therefore, do they belong to self; and how are they connected with it? For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception. When my perceptions are removed for any time, as by sound sleep; so long am I insensible of myself, and may be truly said not to exist. And were all my perceptions removed by death, and could I neither think, nor feel, nor see, nor love, nor hate after the dissolution of my body, I should be entirely annihilated, nor do I conceive what is farther requisite to make me a perfect non-entity. If anyone, upon serious and unprejudiced reflection thinks he has a different notion of himself, I must confess I call reason no longer with him. All I can allow him is, that he may be in the right as well as I, and that we are essentially different in this particular. He may perceive something simple and continued, which he calls himself; though I am certain there is no such principle in me.”
